    "The 'Borrow' class is not correctly representing the relationship between 'User' and 'Book'. It should not be a separate class but rather a relationship that indicates which user has borrowed which book.",
    "The 'Borrow' class should include a reference to both 'User' and 'Book' to indicate the borrowing relationship directly, rather than having a separate class for borrowing.",
    "The multiplicity on the 'Book' to 'Borrow' relationship is incorrect. It should be '1' to '0..1' indicating that a book can be borrowed by one user at a time, but can also be available (not borrowed)."
